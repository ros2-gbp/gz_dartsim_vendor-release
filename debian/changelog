ros-jazzy-gz-dartsim-vendor (0.0.2-1noble) noble; urgency=high

  * Add dependency on fmt, patch pkgconfig installation
  * Change version to 0.0.1
  * Fix linter (#3 <https://github.com/gazebo-release/gazebo_dartsim_vendor/issues/3>)
  * Remove Octomap (#2 <https://github.com/gazebo-release/gazebo_dartsim_vendor/issues/2>)
    Octomap is an optional dependency. There seems to be an issue resolving
    this key on the ROS buildfarm, so disabling it for now.
    This also removes DART_BUILD_OSG cmake flag, which does not exist in 6.13.2
  * Add README (#1 <https://github.com/gazebo-release/gazebo_dartsim_vendor/issues/1>)
  * Rename to gz_dartsim_vendor
  * Add license and contributing files
  * Change name and update version
  * Remove optional packages
  * Initial import
  * Contributors: Addisu Z. Taddese
